This project is a machine learning (ML) project that predicts the weight of fish based on various input features. The purpose of this project is to develop an accurate ML model that can predict the weight of fish based on their physical measurements.

## **Data**

The raw data used for this project contains information on the weight of different types of fish and various features that affect their weight. The data was preprocessed to clean and encode the variables and split into training and testing sets.

## **Model**

The ML model used for this project is a XGgradient boosting regressor implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The code for the model can be found in the model.py file.

## **Usage**

To run the project, first install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Enter the required inputs, and the app will predict the price of fish.

## **Dependencies**

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Streamlit

### **Credits**

The raw data used for this project was sourced from a public data repository.
